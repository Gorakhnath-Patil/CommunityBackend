Overview:
This repository contains a Java Spring Boot application that serves as a basic template for building web applications with JPA (Java Persistence API). The application provides functionality for managing users and stars. Users can be created, updated, and deleted, and they can receive stars from other users.

Features:

User Management: Create, update, and delete user profiles with essential information like username, name, email, contact, bio, and website link.
Star System: Allow users to give stars to other users, creating a Many-to-One relationship between stars and users.
Data Persistence: Utilize JPA to provide seamless integration with a relational database for data storage.
Technologies Used:

Java Spring Boot: The backbone of the application, providing a powerful and efficient framework for building robust web applications.
Java Persistence API (JPA): Enables the interaction between Java objects and a relational database, simplifying data persistence.
Hibernate: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool used for mapping Java objects to database tables and vice versa.
H2 Database: An in-memory database used for local development and testing purposes.
Maven: A build automation tool for managing dependencies and project structure.
Spring Data JPA: Provides easy and efficient access to JPA capabilities within the Spring Framework.
Getting Started:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Gorakhnath-Patil/CommunityBackend.git
Build the project: mvn clean install
Run the application: mvn spring-boot:run
Usage:

Access the application at: http://localhost:8081
Use API endpoints for CRUD operations on users and stars.
Sample API endpoints:

Create a new user: POST /api/users
Get all stars for a user: GET /api/users/{userId}/stars
